# Coding patterns

## Style of coding

- Always prefer simple, readable code over compact, dense code.
- Avoid duplicating code, meaning search for existing code that can be reused instead of creating new code that is similar.
- Try to use already existing design and architecture patterns instead of inventing your own.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and focused, ideally less than 50 lines of code.
- Keep classes and modules small and focused, ideally less than 300 lines of code. If larger, try to split them into smaller classes or modules.

## Error handling

- Always handle errors and edge cases.
- If an error is not handled, it should at least be logged.
